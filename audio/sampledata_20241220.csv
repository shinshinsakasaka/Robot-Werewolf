0:00:43,0:00:44,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
0:00:44,0:00:45,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah, I think you're all nice."
0:00:45,0:00:46,SPEAKER_01, Ready?

0:00:59,0:01:00,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, great."
0:01:00,0:01:02,SPEAKER_01, And then I will advance.
0:01:05,0:01:07,SPEAKER_01, And then I will choose the
0:01:09,0:01:18,SPEAKER_01," Wall of Minion, Robert, Chobo Maker, Drunk and Hunter."
0:01:19,0:01:19,SPEAKER_01, Stopped.
0:01:19,0:01:23,SPEAKER_01, And I got my role.
0:01:23,0:01:25,SPEAKER_01, You got the role.
0:01:29,0:01:30,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
0:01:30,0:01:30,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
0:01:30,0:01:31,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
0:01:37,0:01:39,SPEAKER_01, And then keep clicking the white dot.
0:01:39,0:02:06,SPEAKER_01," Now, Minions, Good Night Minion, Robert, Good Night, Chobo Maker, Good Night, Chobo Maker,"
0:02:07,0:02:08,SPEAKER_00, Drunk.
0:02:12,0:02:13,SPEAKER_00," Don't know, Junk."
0:02:14,0:02:16,SPEAKER_01," Now, yeah, good morning, everybody."

0:02:19,0:02:19,SPEAKER_02, Nice.
0:02:19,0:02:24,SPEAKER_02," And then so, I think at this point, you are not, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly."
0:02:24,0:02:24,SPEAKER_01, We should discuss.
0:02:28,0:02:29,SPEAKER_02, Based on.
0:02:30,0:02:35,SPEAKER_01," Based on, I think you can say whatever you thought that are coming up on the screen."
0:02:37,0:02:39,SPEAKER_02," So, basically, they are the location."
0:02:40,0:02:43,SPEAKER_01," No, no, no, because you're distracting dots."
0:02:43,0:02:49,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so, so, like, you can see, now is the action time for the world, right?"
0:02:49,0:02:55,SPEAKER_01," And if you start, like, tapping the phone, I can tell, like, you're the world, right?"
0:02:56,0:02:58,SPEAKER_01, Does that make sense?
0:02:58,0:02:58,SPEAKER_02," Yes, okay."
0:02:58,0:03:02,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, so, like, they just run them, we show, like, white dots."
0:03:03,0:03:06,SPEAKER_01," So, that regardless of your role, we just keep, like, tapping the white dots"
0:03:07,0:03:08,SPEAKER_01, so that we cannot know.
0:03:10,0:03:12,SPEAKER_01," Like, people's role based on whether or not."
0:03:12,0:03:13,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that is just, yeah."
0:03:13,0:03:14,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
0:03:14,0:03:15,SPEAKER_01, We confuse us.
0:03:15,0:03:16,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
0:03:16,0:03:17,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah."
0:03:17,0:03:18,SPEAKER_01," Okay, yeah."
0:03:19,0:03:26,SPEAKER_01," Okay, so, to make the discussion further, I would just say, I was a Chobo Maker,"
0:03:27,0:03:31,SPEAKER_01, and then I exchanged the role.
0:03:31,0:03:32,SPEAKER_01," Oh, really?"
0:03:32,0:03:33,SPEAKER_01," Yes, I did."
0:03:36,0:03:37,SPEAKER_00, I don't believe you.
0:03:38,0:03:39,SPEAKER_00, I did.
0:03:39,0:03:39,SPEAKER_00, It did?
0:03:39,0:03:40,SPEAKER_01," I did, yeah."
0:03:42,0:03:42,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
0:03:44,0:03:46,SPEAKER_01," So, Chobo Maker is the villager side?"
0:03:47,0:03:48,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
0:03:48,0:03:48,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
0:03:54,0:03:55,SPEAKER_01," So, I'm on the villager side."
0:03:55,0:03:56,SPEAKER_01," So, what were you?"
0:03:56,0:04:00,SPEAKER_00," I was just wondering, is it possible?"
0:04:03,0:04:04,SPEAKER_01," So, both of you are not well."
0:04:06,0:04:07,SPEAKER_01," It's also possible, right?"
0:04:07,0:04:07,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
0:04:07,0:04:08,SPEAKER_01," There are three cousins, doesn't it?"
0:04:08,0:04:10,SPEAKER_01," But, yeah."
0:04:10,0:04:10,SPEAKER_02, It can be.
0:04:10,0:04:11,SPEAKER_02, It can be one of them.
0:04:13,0:04:13,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
0:04:15,0:04:15,SPEAKER_02, Are you well?
0:04:18,0:04:19,SPEAKER_02, No.
0:04:19,0:04:20,SPEAKER_02, You were not.
0:04:20,0:04:24,SPEAKER_01," Because, because I exchanged the cards, you guys know."
0:04:26,0:04:28,SPEAKER_01, You guys don't know your own role.
0:04:28,0:04:30,SPEAKER_02, You really exchanged the cards?
0:04:30,0:04:30,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I did."
0:04:31,0:04:31,SPEAKER_02, Sure.
0:04:32,0:04:33,SPEAKER_01, I'm sure.
0:04:34,0:04:35,SPEAKER_02," That's both him, huh?"
0:04:38,0:04:39,SPEAKER_01," Come on, guys."
0:04:39,0:04:41,SPEAKER_01, This is like the bad game.
0:04:41,0:04:44,SPEAKER_01," And then, I still don't know how to play it."
0:04:44,0:04:45,SPEAKER_01," So, I think I'll vote you."
0:04:46,0:04:46,SPEAKER_01, Me?
0:04:46,0:04:47,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.

0:05:05,0:05:06,SPEAKER_01," So, you were wrong, right?"
0:05:06,0:05:07,SPEAKER_01, No.
0:05:08,0:05:08,SPEAKER_01, Already?
0:05:08,0:05:10,SPEAKER_01, What is the illusion?
0:05:10,0:05:12,SPEAKER_02," No, no, no, I just exchanged the cards."
0:05:12,0:05:13,SPEAKER_01," No, I was a hunter."
0:05:14,0:05:14,SPEAKER_01, What the fuck?
0:05:14,0:05:15,SPEAKER_01, What happened?
0:05:15,0:05:17,SPEAKER_01," Okay, I'll tell what happened."
0:05:17,0:05:19,SPEAKER_02, I was a drunk.

0:05:21,0:05:23,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, I really exchanged the cards, yeah."
0:05:23,0:05:25,SPEAKER_01," So, you exchanged both of us."
0:05:26,0:05:28,SPEAKER_02, She was a troublemaker.
0:05:29,0:05:30,SPEAKER_02," No, I was a troublemaker."
0:05:30,0:05:31,SPEAKER_01, She was the hunter.
0:05:31,0:05:32,SPEAKER_02, I was the drunk.
0:05:32,0:05:34,SPEAKER_02," So, you exchanged us."
0:05:34,0:05:36,SPEAKER_02, I became the hunter.
0:05:36,0:05:40,SPEAKER_02," And then, I swept my card with the middle one."
0:05:40,0:05:41,SPEAKER_02," Oh, okay."
0:05:41,0:05:43,SPEAKER_02, And the variable was one of those.
0:05:43,0:05:45,SPEAKER_02," Oh, so you chose that."
0:05:45,0:05:46,SPEAKER_01," You chose the wolf, yeah."
0:05:46,0:05:47,SPEAKER_02," No, no."
0:05:47,0:05:47,SPEAKER_02, I didn't see.
0:05:48,0:05:49,SPEAKER_01," Like, I cannot see."
0:05:49,0:05:50,SPEAKER_02," Oh, so you didn't know."
0:05:50,0:05:53,SPEAKER_02," I just, I might always just to swipe the card with the middle one."
0:05:54,0:05:57,SPEAKER_02," And I will not know, like, what role I have got."
0:05:57,0:05:58,SPEAKER_02, Maybe we lost.
0:05:59,0:05:59,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
0:05:59,0:06:00,SPEAKER_02," So, I won."
0:06:01,0:06:01,SPEAKER_02, I won.
0:06:02,0:06:04,SPEAKER_01, I think it's working now.
0:06:04,0:06:05,SPEAKER_01," So, I will stop the recording."
